# Game: Ghost Puncher

Two screens, you control a sprite on one screen while your opponent controls a similar sprite on the other.
By moving the navswitch N/S, you can move the in those directions. You can go one pixel offscreen. By pushing in on the navswitch and then in a second direction you can perform an attack.
An attack will land if your sprite overlaps theirs, but watch out! This means they may also attack you!

You have 14 health. The game ends when one player (the loser) runs out of health, which is displayed in a bar across the top of the screen.
